<H1>What is CSS?</h1>

<p>HTML was originally intended to express logical document structure (such as headings, paragraphs, and lists), but not to control display characteristics (such as layout and formatting). Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are now combined with HTML and are used to control the layout and formatting, tus allowing a single source of HTML to be reformatted for use on multiple devices.</p>
